# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Users can play the game in a 2 player mode. Enjoy!

Rules:-

Player1 vs Player2
The player with the "X" mark starts the game.
The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full and there is no winner, there is a draw.
The "Reset all" button resets all of the previous results and the players' marks have to be chosen again.
The "New Game" button starts a new game with previous results still visible.
Start
When DOM is loaded, the player has to choose his mark. After this the game begins. At this stage the player can't slide the page. 

Game:-

After every click on the empty box on the board the active player changes. When the game is finished, the boxes that match the winning combinations change their color which shows the exact winning combination. After this the new game can be started (the players' marks stay the same and the results are still being counted) or the whole page can be reset and the game starts from the beginning.
